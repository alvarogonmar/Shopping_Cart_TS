# GuitarLA Shopping Cart

Web Application using HTML, React, and TypeScript

## Web Overview

The web application allows users to explore a guitar catalog, view details, and manage a shopping cart. It uses Local Storage to persist the cart's state, ensuring data persists even if the user reloads the page or closes the browser.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Catalog**: Guitar data is sourced from a simulated database, including name, image, description, and price.
- **Interactive Cart**: Users can:
  - Add guitars to the cart.
  - Increase or decrease the quantity of a product.
  - Remove specific products from the cart.
  - Clear the cart entirely.
- **Data Persistence**: The cart state is saved in Local Storage, ensuring selected products remain available across sessions.
- **Total Calculation**: The application automatically calculates the total cost of the products in the cart.
